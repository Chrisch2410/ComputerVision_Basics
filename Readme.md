#  Computer Vision Basics

## Introduction 

In this course we will talk about the basics of computer vision, in which we will emphasize the following topics:

- Color and color filtering.
- Morphologic filters. 
- Edge detection and a brief introduction to convolutions. 
- Color Spaces.

### What is  computer vision ? 

Computer vision commonly abbreviated as CV could be described as a field of study that allows a computer to analise and have understanding of an uploaded digital image or group of images such as videos. 

The main idea of ​​CV along with robotics and other fields of study is to help and improve tasks that could be exhaustive or repetitive for humans. In recent years, there have been many improvements with the invention of complex systems of computer vision and deep learning, such as the well-known convolutional neural networks, which changed the point of view to solve many problems, such as facial recognition or medical images among others. 

For this course in specific we are going to make use of python 3.5 and opencv, despite this python version can be considered a little old, is a very stable version, however you can fell free to change to newest versions like python 3.7, some featueres may change, but it keeps the main idea.
